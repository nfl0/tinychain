To implement a TinyChain blockchain system that supports up to 2 nodes with a RAID-1-like system for data protection and maximum uptime. these steps provide a high-level guideline to get you started on the path to achieving maximum uptime and data protection in your TinyChain blockchain system with two nodes:
- Node Configuration: Node A and Node B, each running a separate instance of tinychaind. Node A and Node B can communicate with each other.
- Data Replication: Implement a data replication mechanism between Node A and Node B to ensure that the blockchain data is synchronized between both nodes. Whenever a block is forged on one node, it should be replicated to the other node.
- Block Forgin: Both Node A and Node B should have the capability to forge new blocks. Implement a mechanism to ensure that only one node is forging at a time. You can use a simple lock or flag to achieve this. When one node is forging, the other should wait. Make sure that when a new block is forged on one node, it's also propagated to the other node.
- Inter-Node Communication: the WebSocket communication to allow Node A and Node B to send and receive blocks and transactions between each other. When a new block is forged on one node, it should be broadcasted to the other node over WebSocket.
- Data Protection: implement error handling and recovery mechanisms in case one of the nodes goes down or experiences data corruption. Consider mechanisms for automatic data recovery
- Monitoring: Implement robust monitoring and logging to track the status and health of both nodes. Set up alerts and notifications for any critical issues or failures.
