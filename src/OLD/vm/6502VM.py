; This program implements a simple banking system that allows user 1 and user 2
; to deposit and withdraw funds from their accounts.

; The program starts by initializing the accounts of user 1 and user 2 to 1000 and 2000, respectively.

    LDA #$1000   ; Load 1000 into the accumulator
    STA $01      ; Store it in memory location $01 (User 1's account)
    LDA #$2000   ; Load 2000 into the accumulator
    STA $02      ; Store it in memory location $02 (User 2's account)

; The program then enters a loop where it reads a command from the user.

LOOP:
    LDA $00      ; Load the command from memory location $00

    ; If the command is "D", the program deposits the specified amount into the specified account.
    CMP #"D"     ; Compare with ASCII "D"
    BEQ DEPOSIT

    ; If the command is "W", the program withdraws the specified amount from the specified account.
    CMP #"W"     ; Compare with ASCII "W"
    BEQ WITHDRAW

    ; If the command is "Q", the program quits.
    CMP #"Q"     ; Compare with ASCII "Q"
    BEQ QUIT

    ; Invalid command, go back to the loop.
    JMP LOOP

; The deposit and withdraw procedures are implemented as follows:

DEPOSIT:
    LDA $01      ; Load the balance of the account (User 1's account)
    CLC          ; Clear the carry flag
    ADC $03      ; Add the amount to deposit (from memory location $03)
    STA $01      ; Store the new balance in User 1's account
    JMP LOOP     ; Jump back to the start of the loop

WITHDRAW:
    LDA $02      ; Load the balance of the account (User 2's account)
    SEC          ; Set the carry flag
    SBC $03      ; Subtract the amount to withdraw (from memory location $03)
    STA $02      ; Store the new balance in User 2's account
    JMP LOOP     ; Jump back to the start of the loop

QUIT:
    BRK          ; Break (halt the program)
